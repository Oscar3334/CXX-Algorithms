This project uses C++, CMake, and Boost ut for unit testing. This is my attempt to write some of the algorithms in the C++ stl in addition to understanding unit testing, albeit most if not all of the code is poorly written.

To run the code, clone this repo and run these commands.
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ ctest
```
